### Installation-

This website should run fine on almost any webserver. We tested it with Apache and Nginx. At the moment we use MySQL as database.
Configuration is done via the `db.conf.php` and front-end languages can be added through copying one of the existig files inside the `languages` directory and modifying the strings.

### API-

The API is accessible via [https://evilinsult.com/generate_insult.php](https://evilinsult.com/generate_insult.php).

It supports `plain text`, `XML` and `JSON`.

Example for an English insult with [JSON](https://www.json.org/) output: [https://evilinsult.com/generate_insult.php?lang=en&type=json](https://evilinsult.com/generate_insult.php?lang=en&type=json)

### Live-
You can view this website live on [https://evilinsult.com/](https://evilinsult.com/) or visit the [slave](https://slave.evilinsult.com/).

By the way, only evil projects like this one should use terms like `slave` or `master`, normal projects should use [inclusive language](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19539741/86518890-65484280-be35-11ea-93bf-a03f73284208.png).
