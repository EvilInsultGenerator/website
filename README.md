### Installation

This website should run fine on almost any webserver. We tested it with Apache and Nginx. At the moment we use MySQL as database.
Configuration is done via the `db.conf.php` and front-end languages can be added through copying one of the existig files inside the `languages` directory and modifying the strings.
